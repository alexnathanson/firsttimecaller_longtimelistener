# firsttimecaller_longtimelistener

First Time Caller, Long Time Lister is a 2016 performance by Fan Letters.

The performance is controlled by 5 programs.

<br> 1) The transition program creates the render context and manages the seemless transition between pieces over the course of the show.
<br> 2) The First Time Caller patch controls the all of the video and animation behaviours as well as manages communication with the microcontroller (4), and audio (5).
<br> 3) The polyloads patch creates multiple instances of video files to load.
<br> 4) The arduino sketch controls the speed of the motor driven percussive instruments and communicates with Max.
<br> 5) The 5th program involves with this peice is a super collider program written by my collaborator Dylan Neely.
